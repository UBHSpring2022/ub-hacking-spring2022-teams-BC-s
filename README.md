# **DeHungr**

Around the world, more than enough food is produced to feed the global populationâ€”but as many as 811 million people still go hungry. After steadily declining for a decade, world hunger is on the rise, affecting 9.9 percent of people globally. From 2019 to 2020, the number of undernourished people grew by as many as 161 million, a crisis driven largely by conflict, climate change, and the COVID-19 pandemic

Our projects provides a decentralised solution to this problem which allows the user to donate dietary items in exchange of Fungible Tokens by making a transaction on blockchain.

We have built it using Blockchain technology, truffle suite, ganache and frontend tech.

The main problem we ran into was metamask registration transaction and Integration of the smart contract created using Solidity language with the UI using web3.js

We managed to successfully implement our project using Blockchain Technology and we are mostly proud of being able to address the much needed social cause.

Apart from getting to learn the tech side we learnt how to build a socially scalable problem product within a stipulated period of time.

This can be deployed on the main net and used across similar social cases for the community welfare.
